PlaySoundV2 plays a registered sound with default parameters.

PlaySoundExV2 plays a sound with extended parameters.

- path: The file path of the sound to play. The sound must have been previously registered using RegisterSoundV2.

- volume: The volume at which to play the sound, ranging from 0.0 (silent) to 1.0 (full volume).

- pitch: The pitch at which to play the sound. A value of 1.0 plays the sound at normal pitch, values greater than 1.0 increase the pitch, and values less than 1.0 decrease it.

- pan: The pan at which to play the sound, ranging from 0.0 (left channel only) to 1.0 (right channel only), with 0.5 being centered.

- pitchVariance: The range of random pitch variation to apply. For example, a variance of 0.1 could randomly alter the pitch by up to Â±0.1 around the base pitch value.
